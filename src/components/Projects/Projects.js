The user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?” This solidified my understanding of React and Redux. I learned how to manage the application’s state; establish strict rules for getting, listening, and updating the store; and identify what state should live inside of Redux and what state should live inside of React components. The user can also make new questions and the app displays a Leader Board.",
